#SUMMARY OF PROJECT: With this dataset, I have decided to perform a comparison
#between two specific holidays and how they influenced the handling of flights
#travelling in and out of the New York City area during Christmas Day and
#Thanksgiving Day in the year 2013. These holidays were chosen due to the larger
#than usual demand on travel services. With this data, I wanted to learn which  
#holiday has less chances to see delays departing from the three main airports 
#serving NYC: JFK, LGA, and Newark. Depending on which holiday has more flights 
#on that day, I can hypothesize that there would be a higher number of delays. 
#In order to help this, I needed to narrow down the data, and organize it into 
#information that will be relevant.I also conducted additonal research on weather
#conditions in the NYC area during this time from data collected by the NWS, which
#shows that within the NYC during both holidays, weather conditions were stable and
#did not play a significant role to contribute to delays.

#SUMMARY OF DATA CLEANING: The goal is to compare specially arrival and departure 
#times during Christmas Day and Thanksgiving Day in 2013. In addition, I also wanted
#to compare the data between days relating to how many flights experienced either
#delays departing or arriving above 90 minutes, often considered a significant delay.
#Therefore, I have created several dataframes to narrow down the data I was specifically
#searching for on those days. The five larger dataframes are comprised of information
#relating to all flights during the actual holidays, a period around both holidays, and
#a summary of all flights occurring for the months of November and December. The three
#smaller datasets consists of flights where both the arrival and departure times have 
#exceeded 90 minutes.

#CONCLUSION: Based on the data collected, tidied, and plotted across these four charts,
#that there was a higher rate of delays recorded during Christmas Day compared to
#Thanksgiving Day during the year 2013 at New York City airports. As stated before,
#local weather conditions were stable for flying, so it is possible that more delays 
#occuring during Christmas due to either poor weather conditions in destination cities,
#or a possible shortage of staff at NYC airports. What I found interesting, was during
#Thanksgiving Day, there was a higher number of flights, while also maintaining a lower
#number of delayed flights leaving NYC, and leaves me to speculate that destination cities
#have a chance to having more favorable weather for flying on Thanksgiving as opposed to
#Christmas, or that more staff was on-hand during that time. To conclude, the data shows
#despite a higher number of flights occurring, Thanksgiving saw significant fewer delays in
#comparison to Christmas during the year 2013.
